* BACKUP & RESTORE SCRIPTS

Backup or restore all user profiles on a host.

Takes a source and destination as an argument.

Progress bar wrapper provides rather nice user feedback when the profiles are
large.

Provided verbose stream for viewing skipped files.

[[file:RUN.BAT][RUN.BAT]] batch script is used to get around Group Policy limitations in present
environment..

There are two versions of the script - one for Active Directory environments and
one for machines that only have local accounts.

AD Environment Script located [[file:ps/RoboRapAD.ps1][here]].

Local Account Script located [[file:ps/RoboRap.ps1][here]].

*TODO:* Implement hardlinking for incremental backups
